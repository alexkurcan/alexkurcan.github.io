        <h1>My Name is Alex Arias-Kurcan</h1>
        <p>Hello, as you could read by the the title I am Alex Arias-Kurcan. I was born in Dover, Delaware and had lived there up until I was four, however most my family still resides within DE.
            After that my mother had decide to move the Maryland (MD), where we lived for most of my life up until I was 8, which was when we finally ended up here in North Carolina  (NC). To give a little background about me
            My father is from Cebu, Philipines and my mother was too born in Dover, DE. My lola (grandmother in Tagalog) had migrated to the states when my father was young and they have lived within Delaware
            for most of his life and he still lives there now, as well as the rest of my family on my father's side. As for my mother she has only ever lived within the United States. Moving away from the subject of my parents,
            I personally enjoy drawing, writting, or just overall playing games in my free time (and reading). Sometimes when I have the money I will buy a Gundam and build that. And when I'm not wasting away at school I usually just go to work.
